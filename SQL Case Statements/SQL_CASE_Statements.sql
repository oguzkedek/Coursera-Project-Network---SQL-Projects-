#############################
-- Task One: The SQL CASE Statement
-- In this task, we will learn how to write a conditional
-- statement using a single CASE clause
#############################

-- 1.1: Retrieve all the data in the employees table

SELECT * FROM employees;

-- 1.2: Change M to Male and F to Female in the employees table

SELECT first_name, last_name, gender, 
CASE 
	WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 'Male'
	WHEN gender = 'F' THEN 'Female'
END new_gender
FROM employees

-- 1.3: This gives the same result as 1.2

SELECT first_name, last_name, gender, 
CASE 
	WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 'Male'
	ELSE 'Female'
END new_gender
FROM employees;

#############################
-- Task Two: Adding multiple conditions to a CASE statement
-- In this task, we will learn how to add multiple conditions to a 
-- CASE statement
#############################

-- 2.1: Retrieve all the data in the customers table
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- 2.2: Create a column called Age_Category that returns Young for ages less than 30,
-- Aged for ages greater than 60, and Middle Aged otherwise

SELECT age, 
CASE 
	WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young'
	WHEN age > 60 THEN 'Aged'
	ELSE 'Middle Aged'
END Age_Category
FROM customers;

-- 2.3: Retrieve a list of employees that were employed before 1990, between 1990 and 1995, and 
-- after 1995

SELECT emp_no , EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) AS Year,
CASE
	WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) < '1990' THEN 'employed before 1990'
	WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) > '1995' THEN 'employed after 1995'
	ELSE 'employed between 1990 and 1995'
END hire_cat
FROM employees

-- Alternative Solution 

SELECT emp_no , EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) AS Year,
CASE
	WHEN hire_date < '1990-01-01' THEN 'employed before 1990'
	WHEN hire_date > '1995-12-31' THEN 'employed after 1995'
	ELSE 'employed between 1990 and 1995'
END hire_cat

-- Task Three: The CASE Statement and Aggregate Functions
-- In this task, we will see how to use the CASE clause and
-- SQL aggregate functions to retrieve data

-- 3.3: Retrieve a list of the average salary of employees. If the average salary is more than
-- 80000 but less than 100000, return Paid Well. If the average salary is less than 80000, 
-- return Underpaid, otherwise, return Manager

SELECT A.avg_salary_cat, COUNT(*)
